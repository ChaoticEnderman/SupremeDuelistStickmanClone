What this game is?

-A clone for the beloved Supreme Duelist Stickman game, to address some features that the game lack:
-This game will add multiplayer support, something the SDS devs promise for years but unable to do
-Competitive, deterministic design for online competitive play
-Cross-platform since the original game is only for mobile, while competitive players need to use emulators which increase latency

How to download and play?

-Currently it is still in development, but you can download the demo playable builds in the playable folder
-Just the APK files for android
-You guys will need to download the .pck file for the windows .exe file or linux file
